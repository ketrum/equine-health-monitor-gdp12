\section{Design Challenges}
\label{sec:design_challenges}
In the early stages of project, three main challenges were identified: Gut sound monitoring, energy efficiency and wireless connectivity. The problem with these three challenges is, that they cannot be faced independently but have to be seen in a wider context as they are tightly coupled. A design decision that is made in one challenge on behalf of one of the challenges will affect both other fields.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:design_challenges} shows one  way to visualize this three-way tradeoff - it is impossible to design a system with a very high energy efficiency that performs high quality gut sound monitoring and transmits data wirelessly at the same time, because the design space doesn’t contain an operating point for this configuration. 

An example for this is the our goal to be very energy efficient, because battery life is highly important for mobile devices. Aiming for a high energy efficiency puts a constraint on the available choices for a wireless connection, because many wireless protocols are rather energy hungry. At the same time it limits the amount of processing that can be done on the monitoring device, because a busy processor consumes a lot of energy and the aim is to keep the processor sleeping for as long as possible. The cases where sending a larger block of data over wireless is actually more energy-efficient than processing the data on the monitoring device and sending less data over wireless are good illustrations of this tradeoff. \TODO{reference temperature sensor section}

In order to make design solutions for the main challenges a design space analysis was conducted that aimed at finding an operating point close to the center of the triangle. The trade-offs that were taken into consideration will be explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.  
 
Wireless communication between the monitoring device and the base station is another important issue. A wireless protocol solution which satisfies the bandwidth requirements (audio transmission) while consuming only very little energy is desired. 

Gut sound monitoring is the last of the main design challenges. To be able to do any kind of examination based on the audio data, the length of the recording has to be in the minute range. This requires a wireless protocol with a bandwidth that allows to transmit the data in a reasonable amount of time and limits the processing that can be done during recording because the processor should not be involved in the optimal case.

\TODO{Rewrite/Extend next paragraph}

After discussions and research, a good compromise was found which offers a reasonable degree of fulfillment for each challenge.


\section{Proposed System}
The system that we propose to tackle the design challenges is a distributed system, consisting of wireless monitoring devices optimized for battery usage and a stationary base station that collects data from monitoring devices and presents it to the user over a web interface. 

This stands in contrast to the early drafts of the system design in which there is no distinction between monitoring station and base station and the user interacts directly with the system over a wireless protocol commonly available in handheld devices and laptops (Bluetooth) or connects to the device via USB. We realized early that this design was suboptimal, as it’s neither scalable nor suited for running on battery power over an extended period of time as Bluetooth is an energy hog and the data processing cannot be offloaded but has to be performed on the device itself.

Distributing the system gives the possibility to design nodes that are optimized for their role in the overall system, which is especially important in this case. One of the key focus areas of this project is to build a battery powered device with a long battery runtime. This can only be achieved if the goal is kept in mind during all stages of the design, from the selection of the used components to the design of the control software.

\subsection{Distributed system}
\begin{figure}

\caption{Block Diagram: Distributed system}
\label{fig:block_system}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:block_system} shows  block diagram of the proposed system consisting of multiple monitoring devices and a base station. 
The base station is a stationary device connected to a constant energy source. It provide the network for wireless communication between monitoring devices and the base station. Over this network it receives measurement data from monitoring devices which is stored in an internal database. It serves as a common access point for users to retrieve the collected data from multiple monitoring devices and provides easy access from a wide range of devices by presenting the collected data via a web interface.

In order to achieve low power consumption, the monitoring device does periodic sampling with configurable period. The monitor devices first sample and then push the collected data to the base station at periodic intervals. The wireless connection is inactive at all other times. When the base station is out of reach, the data is stored and transmitted during the next successful connection.


\subsection{Wireless connection between nodes}
\label{sec:wireless_connection}
When the decision was made that a distributed system will be developed this also meant that the collected data had to be transmitted wirelessly to the base station, which is as not straightforward as it sounds, given the constraints imposed by the other main challenges that were discussed in section \ref{sec:design_challenges}.

A wireless protocol that had very low energy consumption while offering enough bandwidth to transfer audio signals and supported a range of around 100m  was what the team was looking for.

In the end the choice fell on the ZigBee protocol, which came closest to fulfilling our feature wishlist. The main factors that influenced our decision were

\begin{itemize}
\item Range: up to 100m
\item Power consumption: very low, as it’s specifically designed for low-power applications
\item Bandwidth: up to 250kB/s
\item Complexity: easy to setup and use
\end{itemize}

The system is designed in such a way, that monitoring devices have to establish a connection with the base station if they want to transmit data. For energy saving reason, the monitoring devices send their ZigBee modules to sleep when they are not actively transmitting data. This means that the base station cannot send data (commands/requests) to the monitoring devices at arbitrary points of times. It has to wait until a monitoring device connects to the base station before it can dispatch messages.
