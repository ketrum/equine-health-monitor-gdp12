Diseases such as grass sickness may cause sudden death of horses and in some cases early diagnosis can be life saving. Constant manual monitoring of horses is often not feasible for horse owners who live far from their horses, or own a large number of horses. An automated solution can be used to check vital signs of horses from distance and forward collected data to a veterinary when there is a suspicious situation. A wireless equine health monitor is thus proposed to provide convenience to horse owners for monitoring vital signs of their animals. An alternative usage is data collection for scientific purposes such as bioprofiling.

The system whose design and implementation is covered in this report consists of wireless monitoring devices attached to horses and a base station. Monitoring devices have several sensors which measure vital signs of the horses. The collected sensor data is then sent to the base station or recorded on the memory card on board. Data transferred to the base station is accessible via a web interface. 

The system can be fine-tuned into a commercially exploitable device, and is flexible enough to be usable on humans or animals besides horses.
