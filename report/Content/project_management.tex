\chapter{Project Management}


\section{Development Plan}
The team initially consisted of 6 people. However one member, Ahsan Baig, had to drop the project after the sixth week since he had visa issues. The Gantt chart was created considering six project members. As it was unclear from the beginning if Ahsan would manage to arrive in time for the project he was given tasks that were extensions for the overall system and could be integrated in the later stages of the project, such as display and analysis of collected sensor data. Therefore he could not contribute to project much in the first weeks. His tasks were shared by other people or, as in the case of data analysis, discarded. 

The meetings with Dr John Chad and Dr Neil Smyth about horse grass sickness were effective on excluding data analysis and diagnosis from the project scope. The reasons for this decision will be discussed in more detail in the \TODO{RESEARCH CHAPTER}.

The project was assigned to the team in the second week of the semester. Therefore the team had to start working on the project later than the official release date. This resulted in a tighter schedule and delayed the placement of component orders. \TODO{} However, the team managed to build a working prototype.  


\section{Task Distribution}
Task distribution was made considering skills and interests of all group members. A high degree of parallelisation of tasks was needed to comply with the tight schedule. A shared document was used to record the tasks and their status which can be found in APPENDIX-TASKS. All members attended discussions about system design and did research on component selection. All members with their primary responsibilities are listed below.

\section{Budget Planning}
The team had X budget for this project. The team chose components based on their price, quick availability and technical features. The components used in the project and their costs are listed in the \TODO{APPENDIX-BUDGET}. Samples were requested for some of the components. Therefore both the actual cost the team spent on the components and their actual prices are listed in the appendix
