 We would like to thank Dr. Peter Reid Wilson for letting us undertake this challenging project, 
 for supporting it during the development phase and organizing a field trip that allowed us to test the system under real conditions.

We also owe gratitude to  Dr. John Chad and Dr. Neil Smyth for sharing their knowledge about horses with us and helping us to define a realistic scope for the project.

Energy Micro and Nordic Semiconductor supported of our project generously hardware parts, for which we are very thankful because it sped up the development process a lot.
