\section{Grass Sickness}
Literature research and a discussion session with experts were conducted to acquire extensive knowledge about grass sickness disease. This information was very important to decide which sensor data could be useful and how it could be used to provide indicators for a diagnosis of grass sickness disease. 


\section{Literature Search}
Information about normal vital signs of an adult horse and the symptoms of grass sickness were collected through literature research. This gave us an idea about how the collected data could be used by the experts. 

Grass sickness (equine dysautonomia) is defined as a disease of equids characterised by damage to autonomic, enteric and somatic neurons which cause low gastrointestinal motility and paralysis of the gut as a result of this. It can be classified as acute, subacute and chronic grass sickness based on its severity. Acute grass sickness has a sudden onset while chronic grass sickness shows clinical signs gradually. Horses with acute grass sickness die within 48 hours after the onset of clinical signs while the ones with chronic grass sickness can be saved with intensive care. \cite{robinson2009current}, \cite{edwards2010edaphic} \cite{web}

Symptoms of grass sickness include colic, gastrointestinal stasis and increased heart rate. Therefore heart rate data could be useful to detect grass sickness. Heart rate of a horse with acute grass sickness is typically 70-120 bpm (beats per minute), whereas horses with subacute grass sickness have a heart rate of 60-80 bpm and the ones with chronic grass sickness have that of 50-60 bpm. Heart rate of an adult horse changes between 30-40 bpm under normal conditions. \cite{corley2009equine}, \cite{robinson2009current}

Since low gastrointestinal motility is also an indicator of grass sickness, borborygmi (gut sounds) can be used for diagnosis. Borborygmi is the noise caused by gas and fluid pushed in the gastrointestinal system. It shows the status of the gastrointestinal system. The frequency of borborygmi is 2 to 4 times a minute in normal conditions. Although borborygmi may be an indication of the problems with the gastrointestinal tract, it cannot not provide itself enough evidence to detect them. \cite{corley2009equine}


\section{Discussions with Bioscientists}
The team had meetings with Dr John Chad and Dr Neil Smyth about the project. A presentation about horse gastrointestinal system and gut sound monitoring was given by Dr Smyth. The outcomes of the meetings will be explained in this section. 

Dr. Smyth explained that for performing a successful abdominal examination, four different sites should be auscultated: left and right lower and upper parts of the abdomen. However, the loudest can be heard at the lower right part of the abdomen where the large intestine is. 

The proposed system contains mobile monitoring devices attached to the horses. It is not convenient to use a mobile device with four audio recording units to auscultate four different sites of the body since it would require additional wires for communication. Therefore the monitoring device which contains one single audio recording unit can be placed at the lower right part of the abdomen.

Dr Smyth stated that the situations which may cause too loud or too quiet gut sound vary. There is not a enough data available on the web regarding the properties of gut sounds and the relation of those with common horse illnesses and this tasks are normally performed by specialists based on empirical knowledge. The complexity of diagnosing grass sickness makes an automated solution unfeasible in the scope of this project. Therefore, the goal of the project was shifted from diagnosis to profiling of vital signals.
